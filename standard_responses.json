Could you please let me know if there are any upcoming open days or opportunities to visit the school? I would also appreciate any information about the admissions process and key dates I should be aware of.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nBest regards,  \nSophie Martin",
    "reply": "Dear Sophie,\n\nThank you for your interest in Bassett House School for your daughter. We would be delighted to welcome you to our school.\n\nThe best way to learn more about us is to visit in person. We offer individual tours, allowing you to explore our school, meet our Head and members of our Senior Leadership Team, and see our classrooms and facilities in action. Due to high demand, individual appointments are limited, and priority is given to families who are registered and looking for entry within the next two academic years.\n\nIf you are looking for a place in Nursery or Reception in September 2025, please do get in touch to arrange a private tour with our Head. Additionally, we run individual and small group tours for families every week. You can fill out our <a href=\"https://www.bassetths.org.uk/admissions/visit-us/\" target=\"_blank\">enquiry form</a> and our Admissions team will be in touch to find a suitable time for your visit.\n\nWe also invite you to attend a Stay & Play session in our newly renovated Bassett House Nursery, which is a wonderful opportunity for you and your child to get to know our school in a fun way. You can find more information and register for the Stay & Play sessions <a href=\"https://www.bassetths.org.uk/admissions/attend-a-stay-and-play/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\nIf you have any further questions about the admissions process or key dates, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJess Ottley-Wood  \nDirector of Admissions  \nBassett House School"
