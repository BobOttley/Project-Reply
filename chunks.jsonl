More House celebrated 50 years since moving into Pont Street. More House celebrated its Golden Jubilee. The school moved into its new home at the beginning of the summer term. The school was threatened with closure due to lack of funds. On Saturday 11th October, a group of pupils staged a protest march to Cardinal Heenan\u2019s home in Westminster to save their school. The Cardinal pledged his support with a guarantee from the church, thus saving the school from closure. The school purchased new premises at 22 Pont Street. More House continued to flourish with a complement of 110 girls, when in 1968, the Canonesses decided reluctantly that they must give up the school in order to concentrate on the university chaplaincy, hostel, and Catholic centre. The current parents formed an Association in order to save the school and took it over under lay management. The first cohort of More House girls reached school-leaving age. Mother Veronica left More House to travel to Uganda where she took over a school for African girls, expanded it and raised it to university entry standard. After Mother Veronica\u2019s departure, Mother St Dominic was appointed Headmistress. More House School now had over 90 pupils, had been inspected by the Ministry of Education and was officially recognised as an efficient Independent Secondary School. More House\u2019s pupil roll had now grown and was recognised as an established school with two classes of girls. The Canonesses took St Thomas More as Patron Saint of the school, embodying Faith and Education. was founded by a group of parents and opened by the canonesses of St Augustine to three pupils, in a hostel they ran for Catholic students on Cromwell Road in South Kensington.

Daily, all students amass credits and debits which count towards their House total in addition to points for various events. A different House event is run almost weekly throughout the year. The calendar is varied each year to ensure it remains vibrant and appealing. The stalwart events that have been mainstays throughout the House system include Sports Day, House Talent Show, House Entertainment Production, Engineering Challenge, House Netball, Rounders\u2019 Day, House Brains and Countdown and various subject-specific events. Each of these holds a special place in the heart of our students and the level of engagement from the participants and the audience is always fantastic. The organisation around House activities creates opportunities for pupils to take on responsibility. Taking responsibility enhances self-confidence and develops leadership skills. Opportunities include: planning events and/or assemblies; preparing notice boards, motivating others to participate and leading a team to achieve a common goal. Each House is run by a House Captain from the Upper Sixth. They meet weekly as part of a leadership programme that helps them to develop their confidence leading the House assembly and supports them in planning and running the House events. The House system provides opportunities for pupils to work together from different tutor groups and year groups. It provides opportunities for teamwork and opportunities to reflect how individuals contribute to a shared vision.

Our aim is to provide an Art and Design education of the highest quality, promoting social engagement and a broad view of the world. Pupils are guided in developing a sense of discovery through the making process. Critical thinking and personal reflection are central to pupils developing the skills required to produce meaningful, high-quality artwork. Lessons in observational skills, eye-to-hand coordination, manipulating materials, and colour theory help the girls develop their own style in Art and Design and express themselves. They learn to critically respond to other artworks and deepen their understanding of technique, genre, and the purpose of artistic expression. We devise lessons that allow each pupil\u2019s creative processes to grow organically, supporting them as they flourish into accomplished artists. In Years 7 to 9 pupils will work with a wide variety of techniques including drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, textiles, fashion and costume. The starting point for each year is an understanding of the formal elements and principles of Art and Design. Pupils develop the ability to respond to the work of others during gallery and museum trips and are encouraged to express their own opinions and learn how to validate them. Pupils undertake cross-curricular projects, with a focus on creativity and innovation, to give the pupils an opportunity to work in teams to create, develop and market an idea that will be judged by an industry professional. Pupils are encouraged to attend extra-curricular activities including Art club, Textiles club and Photography club.

This impresses upon the pupils the importance of refining their drawing skills. GCSE Art and Design provides a space where pupils can develop personal ideas and explore creative thinking. Pupils often comment on the freedom and independence of thought afforded them in this subject. Workshop style support sessions are also offered after school. At A level we offer both Textiles, and Art and Design. The courses begin with a review of skills and techniques in the Autumn term of Lower Sixth. Following this, each project begins with a block of observational drawing. They continue to explore creative solutions to their own ideas (with reference to historical and contemporary practitioners), experiment with a range of materials, and produce written work connected to their own chosen area of study. By this stage, they are confident in devising their own projects.They have a plethora of sources to draw inspiration from. Their cultural awareness becomes evident through the connections they make to the work of others.
